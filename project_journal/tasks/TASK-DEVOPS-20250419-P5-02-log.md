# Task Log: TASK-DEVOPS-20250419-P5-02 - Environment Configuration for 2FLocal

**Goal:** Configure and set up staging and production environments for the 2FLocal application, ensuring proper separation of concerns, environment-specific configurations, and secure management of secrets and credentials.

**Context:** The 2FLocal application has completed core functionality, security enhancements, UI/UX improvements, and testing. A CI/CD pipeline has been set up to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Now we need to configure the environments to which the application will be deployed.

## Initial Analysis

The 2FLocal application consists of:
- Backend (Node.js)
- Mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android)

The CI/CD pipeline has been set up using GitHub Actions, with Docker for containerizing the backend and Fastlane for mobile app deployment.

## High-Level Plan

1. Set up Kubernetes manifests for staging and production environments
   - Create namespace configurations
   - Configure deployments for backend services
   - Set up services and ingress resources
   - Configure persistent volume claims for databases
   - Set up horizontal pod autoscalers

2. Set up secrets management
   - Configure Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
   - Set up Sealed Secrets or external-secrets for encrypted secrets
   - Implement secret rotation policies
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

3. Configure environment-specific settings
   - Create ConfigMaps for environment-specific configurations
   - Set up environment variables
   - Configure feature flags
   - Set up environment-specific API endpoints

4. Implement database migration strategy
   - Configure database migration jobs
   - Set up backup and restore procedures
   - Implement data seeding for staging
   - Document migration procedures

5. Set up logging and monitoring
   - Configure Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
   - Set up Loki or ELK stack for logging
   - Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Configure alerts and notifications

6. Document environment configuration
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Document setup procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Document environment-specific considerations

## Implementation Details

### Kubernetes Namespace Configuration

Created namespace configurations for staging and production environments:
- 2flocal-staging namespace for staging environment
- 2flocal-production namespace for production environment

### Backend Service Configuration

Created Kubernetes manifests for the backend service in both environments:
- Deployments with appropriate resource limits and replicas
- Services for internal communication
- Ingress resources for external access
- ConfigMaps for environment-specific settings
- Secrets for sensitive information

### Database Configuration

Created Kubernetes manifests for the PostgreSQL database in both environments:
- StatefulSets for database deployment
- Services for database access
- Persistent Volume Claims for data storage
- Secrets for database credentials
- Backup CronJobs for regular backups
- Migration Jobs for database schema updates

### Monitoring Configuration

Set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana:
- Prometheus deployment for metrics collection
- Grafana deployment for visualization
- ConfigMaps for Prometheus configuration
- Persistent Volume Claims for data storage

### Logging Configuration

Set up logging using the ELK stack:
- Elasticsearch deployment for log storage
- Kibana deployment for log visualization
- Filebeat DaemonSet for log collection
- Persistent Volume Claims for data storage

### Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for the environment configuration:
- Setup procedures
- Environment-specific settings
- Secrets management
- Database migration strategy
- Monitoring and alerting
- Logging
- Troubleshooting guide

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Secure Secrets Management
**Solution:** Used Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information. Documented the use of Sealed Secrets or external-secrets for enhanced security in production.

### Challenge 2: Database Backup and Restore
**Solution:** Implemented CronJobs for regular backups with different schedules for staging and production.

### Challenge 3: Environment-Specific Configuration
**Solution:** Used ConfigMaps and environment variables to manage environment-specific settings.
