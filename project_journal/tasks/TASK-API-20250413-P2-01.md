# Task Log: TASK-API-20250413-P2-01 - Security Assessment/Hardening

**Goal:** Implement proper error handling in the 2FLocal backend application to prevent information leakage and ensure consistent error responses.

## Initial Assessment
- Review current error handling implementation
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities related to error handling
- Design standardized error handling approach
- Implement improvements across all API endpoints
- Add proper logging and environment-specific handling
## Security Assessment Findings

### Current Error Handling Implementation
1. **Basic Global Error Handler**:
   - A simple global error handler middleware exists in index.ts
   - It logs the full error stack to the console (potential information leakage)
   - Returns a generic 500 'Internal Server Error' response

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling in Controllers**:
   - Some errors are handled directly in controllers with specific status codes and messages
   - Others are passed to the global error handler using `next(error)`
   - No standardized format for error responses across endpoints
   - Error handling varies between controllers

3. **Sensitive Information Leakage**:
   - Detailed error information including stack traces are logged to console
   - Some error messages might reveal implementation details
   - No differentiation between development and production environments

4. **Limited Input Validation**:
   - Basic validation exists but is implemented inconsistently
   - No comprehensive validation framework is used
   - Validation logic is duplicated across controllers

5. **Security Issues**:
   - Hardcoded JWT secret fallback in authController.ts
   - No rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
   - No standardized approach to prevent information disclosure

### Risk Analysis
| Issue | Risk Level | Impact | Likelihood |
|-------|------------|--------|------------|
| Sensitive Information Leakage | High | Could expose internal implementation details, database structure, or other sensitive information to attackers | High |
| Inconsistent Error Handling | Medium | May lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security gaps | Medium |
| Limited Input Validation | High | Could allow injection attacks, data corruption, or other security vulnerabilities | High |
| Hardcoded Secrets | Critical | Could lead to compromise of the authentication system if code is exposed | Medium |
| No Environment-Specific Handling | Medium | Development-specific error details might be exposed in production | Medium |

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a standardized error handling system:
   - Define custom error classes
   - Implement a comprehensive error middleware
   - Ensure environment-specific behavior (dev vs prod)

2. Implement input validation:
   - Add a validation middleware using a library like Joi or express-validator
   - Create validation schemas for all API endpoints

3. Fix security issues:
   - Remove hardcoded secrets
   - Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
   - Ensure proper error logging without sensitive information leakage

4. Update documentation:
   - Document the error handling approach
   - Document the validation approach
## Implementation Details

### 1. Custom Error Classes
Created a set of custom error classes in `backend/src/utils/errors.ts` to standardize error handling across the application:

- `ApiError`: Base error class with standardized properties
- Specific error classes for different HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, etc.)
- Helper function to determine if an error is an instance of ApiError

### 2. Error Handling Middleware
Implemented a comprehensive error handling middleware in `backend/src/middleware/errorMiddleware.ts` with the following features:

- Environment-specific error handling (development vs production)
- Standardized error response format
- Secure error logging that doesn't leak sensitive information in production
- 404 handler for routes that don't exist
- Async handler utility to simplify error handling in async route handlers

### 3. Security Headers
Added security headers to the application in `backend/src/index.ts`:

- Removed X-Powered-By header to avoid exposing Express
- Added X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Added X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Added X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Added Strict-Transport-Security
- Added Content-Security-Policy

### 4. Rate Limiting
Implemented rate limiting middleware in `backend/src/middleware/rateLimitMiddleware.ts` with different limiters for different types of endpoints:

- General API rate limiter for all API routes
- Authentication rate limiter for login and register endpoints
- Password reset rate limiter for forgot-password and reset-password endpoints
- Account creation rate limiter for register endpoint
- TOTP generation rate limiter for TOTP code generation endpoint

### 5. Removed Hardcoded Secrets
Removed hardcoded JWT secret in `backend/src/controllers/authController.ts` and replaced it with a strict environment variable check that exits the application if the JWT_SECRET is not set.

### 6. Input Validation
Created a validation middleware using express-validator in `backend/src/middleware/validationMiddleware.ts` that:

- Validates request data using express-validator rules
- Provides consistent error handling for validation failures
- Returns standardized validation error responses

Created validation schemas for all API endpoints in `backend/src/utils/validationSchemas.ts` with comprehensive validation rules for:

- User registration and login
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Profile updates
- Account secret management
- TOTP code generation
- Device management

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Information Leakage**: Sensitive error details are only shown in development, not in production.
2. **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all API endpoints.
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation prevents injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks, denial of service attacks, and other types of abuse.
5. **Security Headers**: Protects against various attacks like clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, etc.
6. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive credentials in the codebase.
