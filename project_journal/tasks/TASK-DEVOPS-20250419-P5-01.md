# Task: Set up CI/CD Pipeline for 2FLocal Application

**Task ID:** TASK-DEVOPS-20250419-P5-01
**Status:** Pending
**Assigned To:** CI/CD Specialist
**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20250413-195816
**Created:** 2025-04-19 12:45:50

## Goal
Set up a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the 2FLocal application to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent quality and streamlined releases.

## Context
The 2FLocal application has completed core functionality, security enhancements, UI/UX improvements, and testing. The next step is to set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This will ensure that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual errors and improving the development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement automated testing:
   - Configure automated unit tests for backend
   - Configure automated unit and component tests for frontend
   - Configure automated E2E tests
   - Generate and publish test coverage reports

2. Set up build automation:
   - Configure automated builds for backend
   - Configure automated builds for iOS and Android apps
   - Implement versioning strategy
   - Generate build artifacts

3. Implement deployment automation:
   - Configure deployment to staging environment
   - Set up manual promotion to production
   - Implement rollback mechanism
   - Configure environment-specific configurations

4. Add quality gates:
   - Implement code quality checks (linting, formatting)
   - Set up security scanning
   - Configure test coverage thresholds
   - Add performance testing

5. Create notification system:
   - Configure notifications for build failures
   - Set up notifications for deployment status
   - Implement monitoring alerts
   - Create dashboard for pipeline status

6. Document CI/CD pipeline:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the pipeline
   - Document deployment process
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Document rollback procedures

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
2. Configure test automation
3. Set up build automation
4. Implement deployment automation
5. Add quality gates
6. Create notification system
7. Document CI/CD pipeline

#### Fastlane Configuration for iOS
```ruby
# app/ios/fastlane/Fastfile
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Build and upload to TestFlight"
  lane :beta do
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: "TwoFLocal.xcodeproj")
    build_app(workspace: "TwoFLocal.xcworkspace", scheme: "TwoFLocal")
    upload_to_testflight
  end

  desc "Build and upload to App Store"
  lane :release do
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: "TwoFLocal.xcodeproj")
    build_app(workspace: "TwoFLocal.xcworkspace", scheme: "TwoFLocal")
    upload_to_app_store(
      skip_metadata: true,
      skip_screenshots: true,
      skip_binary_upload: false
    )
  end
end
```

## DevOps Considerations
- Ensure secrets and credentials are stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- Use environment variables for environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper versioning strategy for releases
- Set up monitoring and alerting for the CI/CD pipeline
- Configure proper access controls for deployment environments
- Implement rollback procedures for failed deployments
- Consider using feature flags for controlled feature rollout
