# Task Log: TASK-UI-20250419-P4-01 - UI Design: Implement UI Design System for 2FLocal Mobile App

**Goal:** Design and implement a consistent, accessible, and visually appealing UI design system for the 2FLocal mobile application using React Native Paper.

## Initial Analysis

The 2FLocal application has completed core functionality and security enhancements. The app now needs a cohesive visual design system to improve usability and aesthetics while maintaining its security-focused nature.

### Current Status

### Implementation Plan
1. Install required dependencies
2. Define color palette and typography system
3. Create theme configuration files
