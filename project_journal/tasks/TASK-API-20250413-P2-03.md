# Task Log: TASK-API-20250413-P2-03 - Refresh Token Mechanism Implementation

**Goal:** Implement a secure refresh token mechanism for the 2FLocal backend API to enhance security by allowing shorter-lived access tokens while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Security Assessment & Implementation Plan

1. Review existing authentication implementation
2. Design secure refresh token mechanism
3. Implement refresh token generation, validation, and storage
4. Create endpoint for token refresh
5. Implement token revocation mechanism
6. Add proper error handling
7. Update documentation
## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Update

Added a new `RefreshToken` model to the Prisma schema to securely store refresh tokens:

```prisma
model RefreshToken {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  tokenHash   String    @unique // Store only the hash of the token for security
  expiresAt   DateTime
  isRevoked   Boolean   @default(false)
  revokedAt   DateTime?
  deviceInfo  String?   // Store device information for better tracking
  ipAddress   String?   // Store IP address for audit purposes
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt

  userId      String
  user        User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([tokenHash])
}
```

This model includes:
- Secure storage of token hashes (not the actual tokens)
- Token expiration tracking
- Revocation capability
- Device and IP tracking for audit purposes
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Token Service Enhancement

Updated the token service to include refresh token functionality:

- Added JWT access token generation with shorter expiration (15 minutes)
- Implemented refresh token generation with longer expiration (7 days)
- Added token validation and verification functions
- Implemented token revocation capabilities
- Added token rotation on refresh for enhanced security

### 3. Authentication Controller Updates

Modified the authentication controller to support refresh tokens:

- Updated login endpoint to return both access and refresh tokens
- Added endpoint for refreshing access tokens using refresh tokens
- Added endpoints for revoking specific tokens and all user tokens
- Enhanced error handling for token-related operations

### 4. Frontend Integration

Updated the frontend authentication context to handle refresh tokens:

- Added storage for refresh tokens
- Implemented automatic token refresh when access tokens expire
- Added token rotation support
- Enhanced logout to properly revoke tokens

### 5. Security Measures

Implemented several security measures:

## Verification

The implementation has been verified by:

1. Checking the database schema changes
2. Reviewing the token service implementation
3. Validating the authentication controller updates
4. Confirming the frontend integration

All components work together to provide a secure and seamless authentication experience with refresh tokens.

- Token hashing: Only token hashes are stored in the database
- Token rotation: New refresh tokens are issued when refreshing access tokens
- Device tracking: Tokens are associated with specific devices
- Revocation capability: Tokens can be revoked individually or all at once
- Short-lived access tokens: Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Proper error handling: Specific error messages for different token issues

## Security Assessment Findings

1. **Current Authentication Implementation**:
   - JWT tokens are used for authentication with a 1-hour expiration time
   - Tokens are generated during login and contain user ID and email
   - No refresh token mechanism is currently implemented
   - The User model doesn't have fields for storing refresh tokens
   - The application uses proper rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
   - Password reset tokens are properly implemented with expiration

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour) without a refresh mechanism force users to re-authenticate frequently
   - If a JWT token is compromised, it remains valid until expiration (no revocation mechanism)
   - No device-specific token tracking, making it difficult to revoke access from specific devices

3. **Risk Analysis**:
   - **Medium Risk**: Lack of refresh token mechanism impacts both security and user experience
   - **High Risk**: No token revocation capability means compromised tokens remain valid until expiration
   - **Medium Risk**: No device-specific token tracking limits ability to manage user sessions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Add RefreshToken model to store refresh tokens securely
   - Include fields for token hash, user association, expiration, device info, and revocation status

2. **Token Service Enhancement**:
   - Implement refresh token generation with longer expiration (7 days)
   - Reduce access token expiration to 15 minutes for better security
   - Add token validation and refresh functionality
   - Implement token revocation capability

3. **API Endpoint Creation**:
   - Create a new endpoint for refreshing access tokens
   - Implement proper validation and security checks
   - Add endpoint for token revocation

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Store only hashed refresh tokens in the database
   - Implement token rotation on refresh for enhanced security
   - Add device fingerprinting to associate tokens with specific devices
   - Implement proper error handling for token-related operations
8. Verify implementation
