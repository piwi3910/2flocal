# Task Log: TASK-E2E-20250419-P3-01 - E2E Testing

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive E2E tests for the 2FLocal application using Detox.

**Target:** 2FLocal mobile application (iOS and Android)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Detox Configuration

- Added Detox and related dependencies to `package.json`
- Created `.detoxrc.js` configuration file for iOS and Android
- Added E2E testing scripts to `package.json`
- Created Jest configuration for E2E tests in `e2e/config.json`
- Created test initialization file in `e2e/init.js`

### 2. Created Test Utilities

- Implemented test utilities in `e2e/utils/testUtils.js`
- Added helper functions for common operations:
  - User registration and login
  - TOTP account management
  - Search and filtering
  - Element waiting and verification

### 3. Implemented Authentication Flow Tests

Created `e2e/auth.e2e.js` with tests for:
- User registration
- Login with valid and invalid credentials
- Password reset flow
- Logout functionality
- Email verification flow

### 4. Implemented TOTP Management Flow Tests

Created `e2e/totp.e2e.js` with tests for:
- Adding TOTP accounts manually
- Viewing TOTP codes with countdown
- Deleting TOTP accounts
- Searching and filtering TOTP accounts
- QR code scanning flow

### 5. Implemented Security Features and Device Management Tests

Created `e2e/security.e2e.js` with tests for:
- Biometric authentication (when available)
- Device management
- Session management (token refresh, timeout)
- Rate limiting for login attempts

### 6. Created Documentation

- Created comprehensive E2E testing guidelines in `app/docs/e2e-testing-guidelines.md`
- Documented:
  - Test environment setup
  - Running tests
  - Test organization
  - Best practices
  - Element selection strategy
  - Handling flakiness
  - Troubleshooting

### 7. Configured CI Integration

- Created GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
- Configured workflows for both iOS and Android
- Set up artifact collection for test results

## Test Coverage

The implemented E2E tests cover the following critical user flows:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User registration with validation
   - Email verification
   - Login with valid and invalid credentials
   - Password reset
   - Logout

2. **TOTP Management Flow**
   - Adding TOTP accounts manually
   - Adding TOTP accounts via QR code scanning
   - Viewing TOTP codes with countdown
   - Deleting TOTP accounts
   - Searching and filtering TOTP accounts

3. **Device Management Flow**
   - Viewing registered devices
   - Removing devices
   - Device verification

4. **Security Features**
   - Biometric authentication
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Session timeout
   - Rate limiting

## Notes and Considerations

1. **Biometric Authentication Testing**
   - Full biometric authentication testing requires system-level interaction, which is difficult to automate in E2E tests
   - The tests verify the UI flow and handle the case when biometrics are canceled or not available

2. **QR Code Scanning**
   - Actual QR code scanning is difficult to test in E2E tests
   - The tests verify the navigation and UI elements for QR code scanning

3. **Device Management**
   - The device management tests are designed to be skipped if the feature is not yet implemented in the UI
   - Once the device management UI is implemented, the tests will automatically run

4. **Test Data**
   - The tests use random test data to avoid conflicts between test runs
   - Some tests require pre-registered test users (e.g., login tests)

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Backend Tests**
   - Coordinate with backend team to ensure test data consistency
   - Consider implementing a shared test database for E2E tests

2. **Visual Testing**
   - Add visual regression testing to verify UI appearance

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Add performance metrics collection during E2E tests

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Add accessibility checks to E2E tests
