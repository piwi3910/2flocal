# Task Log: TASK-REACT-20250413-P1-01 - React Native Development

**Goal:** Implement authentication UI for the 2FLocal mobile application, including login, registration, email verification, and password reset screens with proper validation and state management.

## Initial Analysis
- Need to implement multiple authentication screens
- Requires form validation and state management
- Must follow mobile design best practices
- Authentication state must persist across app restarts
## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Dependencies**
   - Install React Navigation for navigation
   - Install React Hook Form for form handling
   - Install Yup for validation
   - Install Async Storage for persisting authentication state
   - Install Axios for API requests

2. **Create Folder Structure**
   - Create components, screens, hooks, services, and context folders
   - Set up a consistent file structure for the authentication module

3. **Implement Authentication State Management**
   - Create an AuthContext to manage authentication state
   - Implement token storage and retrieval
   - Create API service for authentication endpoints

4. **Create Authentication Screens**
   - Login screen with email and password fields
   - Registration screen with name, email, and password fields
   - Email verification screen
   - Password reset screens (request and reset)

5. **Implement Form Validation**
   - Create validation schemas for all forms
   - Implement error handling and user feedback

### 2025-04-13
- Created folder structure for the authentication module
- Installed necessary dependencies:
  - axios for API requests
  - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for persisting authentication state
  - @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/stack for navigation
  - react-native-screens, react-native-safe-area-context, and react-native-gesture-handler for navigation
  - react-hook-form, yup, and @hookform/resolvers for form handling and validation
- Implemented authService.ts for handling API requests to the authentication endpoints
- Implemented AuthContext.tsx for managing authentication state across the app
  - Used React Context API for state management
  - Implemented token persistence using AsyncStorage
  - Created authentication functions for login, register, logout, etc.
  - Used useCallback for memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Created validation schemas using Yup for form validation
  - Implemented schemas for login, registration, forgot password, reset password, and profile update forms
  - Added validation rules for email format, password strength, and field matching
- Created reusable UI components for authentication screens
  - Implemented FormInput component for form fields with validation
  - Implemented FormButton component with loading state and different variants
  - Used React Hook Form's Controller for form state management
- Implemented authentication screens
  - Created LoginScreen with email and password fields
  - Created RegisterScreen with name, email, password, and confirm password fields
  - Created ForgotPasswordScreen for requesting password reset
  - Created ResetPasswordScreen for setting a new password
  - Created EmailVerificationScreen for email verification flow
  - Integrated with authentication context for state management
  - Added form validation using Yup schemas
  - Implemented error handling with user feedback
- Implemented navigation for authentication flow
  - Created AuthNavigator for handling navigation between authentication screens
  - Created AppNavigator for handling navigation between authenticated and unauthenticated states
  - Updated App.tsx to use the authentication context and navigation setup
  - Used React Navigation's stack navigator for screen transitions
---
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented authentication UI for the 2FLocal mobile application, including login, registration, email verification, and password reset screens with proper validation and state management. Created a robust authentication context using React Context API for managing authentication state across the app. Implemented form validation using Yup and React Hook Form. Set up navigation using React Navigation for seamless transitions between authentication screens.
