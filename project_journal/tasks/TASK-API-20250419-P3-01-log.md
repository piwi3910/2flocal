# Task Log: TASK-API-20250419-P3-01 - Integration Testing

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for the 2FLocal backend.

## Initial Assessment

The backend currently has no test infrastructure set up. The package.json shows:
- `@types/jest` is already installed
- Missing required dependencies: `jest`, `supertest`, `ts-jest`, `jest-mock-extended`
- No test script configured in package.json

## Implementation Plan

1. Install required testing dependencies
2. Set up Jest configuration for TypeScript
3. Create test utilities (test database setup, mocks, helpers)
4. Implement unit tests for utility functions
5. Implement unit tests for controllers
6. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
7. Configure code coverage reporting
8. Document testing approach and guidelines

## Progress

### [2025-04-19 08:22] Started implementation
- Created task log
- Analyzing current project structure

### [2025-04-19 08:23] Set up testing infrastructure
- Installed required dependencies: `jest`, `supertest`, `ts-jest`, `jest-mock-extended`, `@types/supertest`
- Created Jest configuration file (jest.config.js)
- Updated package.json test scripts
- Created test setup file with Prisma mock

### [2025-04-19 08:25] Implemented unit tests
- Created unit tests for authController (loginUser method)
- Created unit tests for tokenService utility functions

### [2025-04-19 08:26] Implemented integration tests
- Created integration tests for authentication API endpoints (register, login)

### [2025-04-19 08:28] Implemented additional unit tests
- Created unit tests for encryption utility functions
- Created unit tests for TOTP generator utility functions

### [2025-04-19 08:29] Test execution and issues
- Ran tests with `npm test` command
- Some tests passed successfully (7 tests in totpGenerator.test.ts)
- Several test failures identified:
  - Missing environment variables (ENCRYPTION_KEY)
  - Issues with Date.now mocking in tokenService tests
  - Database-related issues (RefreshToken table doesn't exist)
  - QR code handler test failures
- Code coverage is currently at 45.05% (below the 80% target)

### [2025-04-19 08:30] Documentation
- Created comprehensive testing guidelines document (backend/docs/testing-guidelines.md)
- Documented testing approach, organization, and best practices
- Included information on:
  - Testing structure and directory organization
  - Mocking strategies for database and external dependencies
  - Best practices for writing tests
  - Running tests and code coverage requirements

## Summary and Next Steps

### Completed Work
- Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, Supertest, ts-jest, jest-mock-extended)
- Created test setup file with Prisma mock
- Implemented unit tests for:
  - authController (loginUser method)
  - tokenService utility functions
  - encryption utility functions
  - TOTP generator utility functions
- Implemented integration tests for authentication API endpoints
- Created comprehensive testing guidelines document

### Identified Issues
- Missing environment variables (ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Issues with Date.now mocking in tokenService tests
- Database-related issues (RefreshToken table doesn't exist)
- QR code handler test failures
- Code coverage is currently at 45.05% (below the 80% target)

### Next Steps
1. Fix environment variable issues by creating a test-specific .env file
2. Fix Date.now mocking in tokenService tests
3. Create test database setup for integration tests
4. Fix QR code handler tests
5. Implement additional tests to increase code coverage:
   - Complete controller tests (accountController, deviceController, adminController)
   - Add tests for remaining utility functions
   - Add more integration tests for API endpoints
6. Set up CI integration for automated testing
