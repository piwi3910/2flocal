# Task Log: TASK-DEVOPS-20250419-P5-01 - CI/CD Setup for 2FLocal

**Goal:** Set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the 2FLocal application to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

**Context:** The 2FLocal application has completed core functionality, security enhancements, UI/UX improvements, and testing. Now we need to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Initial Analysis

The 2FLocal application consists of:
- Backend (Node.js)
- Mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android)

Both components have Jest configured for testing, and there are E2E tests in the app/e2e directory.

## High-Level Plan

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows
   - Backend workflow for testing, building, and deployment
   - Mobile app workflow for testing and building iOS/Android

2. Configure test automation
   - Unit tests for backend
   - Unit and component tests for frontend
   - E2E tests
   - Test coverage reports

3. Set up build automation
   - Backend builds
   - iOS and Android builds using Fastlane
   - Implement versioning strategy
   - Generate build artifacts

4. Implement deployment automation
   - Staging environment deployment
   - Manual promotion to production
   - Rollback mechanism
   - Environment-specific configurations

5. Add quality gates
   - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
   - Security scanning
   - Test coverage thresholds
   - Performance testing

6. Create notification system
   - Build failure notifications
   - Deployment status notifications
   - Monitoring alerts
   - Pipeline status dashboard

7. Document CI/CD pipeline
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Deployment process
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Rollback procedures

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. Created GitHub Actions workflow for backend:
   - Test job: Runs linting and unit tests, uploads test coverage
   - Build job: Builds the application and uploads artifacts
   - Security Scan job: Runs security audit and SAST scan
   - Deploy to Staging job: Builds and pushes Docker image, deploys to staging
   - Deploy to Production job: Builds and pushes Docker image, deploys to production

2. Created GitHub Actions workflow for mobile app:
   - Test job: Runs linting and unit tests, uploads test coverage
   - Build Android job: Builds Android app and uploads APK
   - Build iOS job: Builds iOS app and uploads IPA
   - E2E Tests job: Runs end-to-end tests using Detox
   - Deploy to TestFlight job: Deploys iOS app to TestFlight
   - Deploy to Play Store job: Deploys Android app to Play Store

### Fastlane Configuration

1. Set up Fastlane for iOS:
   - Created Fastfile with beta and release lanes
   - Created Appfile with app-specific information

2. Set up Fastlane for Android:
   - Created Fastfile with internal, beta, and production lanes
   - Created Appfile with app-specific information

### Docker Configuration

1. Created Dockerfile for backend:
   - Uses Node.js 18 Alpine as base image
   - Installs production dependencies
   - Builds the application
   - Exposes port 3000
   - Sets up command to run the application

2. Created .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files

### Documentation

Created comprehensive CI/CD pipeline documentation in `project_journal/formal_docs/cicd_pipeline_documentation.md` covering:
- Pipeline architecture
- Workflow triggers
- Pipeline stages
- Environment configuration
- Deployment strategy
- Quality gates
- Notification system
- Versioning strategy
- Rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Maintenance and updates
