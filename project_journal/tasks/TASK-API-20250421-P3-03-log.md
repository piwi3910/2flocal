# Task Log: TASK-API-20250421-P3-03 - Email Service Configuration Update

**Goal:** Update the email service configuration in the backend with specific SMTP details.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `backend/.env` file with the following email configuration values:
   - Added `EMAIL_HOST=192.168.100.91`
   - Added `EMAIL_PORT=25`
   - Added `EMAIL_FROM=2flocal@watteel.com`

2. Modified `backend/src/utils/emailService.ts` to handle the no-authentication scenario:
   - Updated the transporter configuration to conditionally include authentication only when credentials are provided
   - Set default values for EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS to empty strings
   - Used a more flexible type definition for the transporter configuration

## Implementation Details

The SMTP server (192.168.100.91) doesn't require authentication, so the email service was modified to work without authentication credentials. The transporter configuration now only includes the auth property when both EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS environment variables are provided.

## Testing

The email service should now be able to send emails using the configured SMTP server without authentication.

**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Updated email service configuration to use the specified SMTP server (192.168.100.91) on port 25 without authentication and with the from address 2flocal@watteel.com.
