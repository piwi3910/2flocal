   - List item animations
6. Add loading animations
   - Skeleton screens
   - Loading indicators
   - Pull-to-refresh animations
7. Implement accessibility features
   - Respect reduced motion preferences
   - Alternative visual cues
8. Test and optimize performance

## Progress Updates
Checking the package.json file, I found:
- ✅ `react-native-gesture-handler` is already installed
- ❌ `react-native-reanimated` is not installed
- ❌ `react-native-shared-element` is not installed

Need to install the missing dependencies.

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-shared-element --save
```
Successfully installed the missing dependencies:
```
cd app && npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-shared-element --save
```

Updated babel.config.js to include the Reanimated plugin:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
```

### Step 2: Creating Reusable Animation Components

Now I'll create the animation components directory and implement the reusable animation components.

Created the animations directory and implemented the following reusable animation components:

1. **FadeIn Component** (`app/src/components/animations/FadeIn.tsx`)
   - Animates opacity from 0 to 1
   - Configurable duration and delay
   - Uses Reanimated's shared values and animated styles

2. **SlideIn Component** (`app/src/components/animations/SlideIn.tsx`)
   - Animates elements sliding in from a specified direction (left, right, top, bottom)
   - Configurable distance, duration, and delay
   - Combines translation and opacity animations

3. **Scale Component** (`app/src/components/animations/Scale.tsx`)
   - Animates elements scaling from an initial to final scale
   - Configurable initial/final scale, duration, and delay
   - Includes opacity animation for smooth appearance/disappearance

4. **Index Export File** (`app/src/components/animations/index.ts`)
   - Exports all animation components for easier imports

### Step 3: Implementing TOTP-specific Animations

Now I'll implement the TOTP countdown animation component as specified in the task.
Also need to update babel.config.js to include the Reanimated plugin.
Implemented the following TOTP-specific animation components:

1. **TOTPCountdown Component** (`app/src/components/totp/TOTPCountdown.tsx`)
   - Animates a progress bar that shows the time remaining for a TOTP code
   - Changes color based on time remaining (primary > warning > error)
   - Adds a pulse animation when time is running low
   - Configurable height and style

2. **TOTPRefresh Component** (`app/src/components/totp/TOTPRefresh.tsx`)
   - Provides a smooth animation when TOTP codes update
   - Combines opacity, scale, and translation animations
   - Includes callback for animation completion

3. **TOTPListItem Component** (`app/src/components/totp/TOTPListItem.tsx`)
   - Animates TOTP account items in a list
   - Provides staggered entrance animations based on item index
   - Includes press animations for feedback
   - Supports removal animations with callback

4. **Index Export File** (`app/src/components/totp/index.ts`)
   - Exports all TOTP animation components for easier imports

### Step 4: Implementing Loading Animations

Implemented the following loading animation components:

1. **SkeletonLoader Component** (`app/src/components/loading/SkeletonLoader.tsx`)
   - Creates skeleton loading screens for data fetching
   - Supports different shapes (rectangle, circle, text, card)
   - Includes shimmer animation effect
   - Provides predefined components for common use cases (TextRowSkeleton, CircleSkeleton, CardSkeleton, TOTPItemSkeleton)

2. **LoadingSpinner Component** (`app/src/components/loading/LoadingSpinner.tsx`)
   - Creates a spinning loading indicator
   - Configurable size, color, and thickness
   - Includes LoadingOverlay component for full-screen loading states

3. **PullToRefresh Component** (`app/src/components/loading/PullToRefresh.tsx`)
   - Implements pull-to-refresh functionality with animations
   - Customizable colors and behavior
   - Uses React Native's RefreshControl with enhanced animations

4. **Index Export File** (`app/src/components/loading/index.ts`)
   - Exports all loading components for easier imports

### Step 5: Implementing Navigation Transitions

Now I'll implement custom transitions for navigation between screens.
Implemented custom navigation transitions:

1. **Transitions Module** (`app/src/navigation/transitions.ts`)
   - Created a module with predefined transitions for different screen types
   - Implemented fade, slide, modal, and fade-from-center transitions
   - Added a utility function to get the appropriate transition for each route
   - Added tab transition configuration

2. **Updated AppNavigator** (`app/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`)

   - Applied custom transitions to Profile screens
   - Applied tab transitions to the main tab navigator

3. **Updated AuthNavigator** (`app/src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx`)
   - Applied custom transitions to all authentication screens

These transitions provide a more polished and professional feel to the application, with appropriate animations for different types of screens (e.g., modal transitions for detail screens, fade transitions for camera screens).

### Step 6: Implementing Micro-interactions

Now I'll implement micro-interactions for buttons, touchable elements, form inputs, and form submissions.
Now I'll implement loading animations including skeleton screens, loading indicators, and pull-to-refresh animations.

### Step 1: Checking and Installing Dependencies
Implemented micro-interactions for UI elements:

1. **AnimatedButton Component** (`app/src/components/interactions/AnimatedButton.tsx`)
   - Provides smooth press animations for buttons
   - Supports different variants (primary, secondary, outline, text)
   - Supports different sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Includes customizable styling options

   - Provides pre-configured SuccessFeedback and ErrorFeedback components

5. **Index Export File** (`app/src/components/interactions/index.ts`)
   - Exports all interaction components for easier imports

Implemented accessibility features for animations:

1. **Reduced Motion Hook** (`app/src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`)
   - Detects if the user has enabled reduced motion preferences
   - Uses React Native's AccessibilityInfo API
   - Listens for changes to the user's preferences

2. **Animation Context** (`app/src/context/AnimationContext.tsx`)
   - Provides animation settings throughout the app
   - Respects user preferences for reduced motion
   - Allows adjusting animation durations
   - Provides alternative visual cues when animations are disabled

3. **Updated App Component** (`app/App.tsx`)
   - Added AnimationProvider to the component hierarchy
   - Ensures all animations respect user preferences

4. **Updated TOTP Countdown** (`app/src/components/totp/TOTPCountdown.tsx`)
   - Respects user preferences for reduced motion
   - Provides alternative visual cues when animations are disabled
   - Adjusts animation durations based on user preferences

These accessibility features ensure that the app respects user preferences for reduced motion and provides alternative visual cues when animations are disabled. This makes the app more accessible to users with motion sensitivity or vestibular disorders.
