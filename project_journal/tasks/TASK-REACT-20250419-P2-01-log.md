# Task Log: TASK-REACT-20250419-P2-01 - Implement Secure Storage for 2FLocal Mobile App

**Goal:** Implement secure local storage for sensitive data in the 2FLocal mobile application by replacing AsyncStorage with react-native-keychain.

**Context:** Currently, the application uses AsyncStorage for storing sensitive data like authentication tokens and user information, which is not secure as it stores data in plaintext.

## Implementation Plan

1. Install react-native-keychain
2. Create a secure storage service that abstracts the keychain operations
3. Update the AuthContext to use the secure storage service
4. Test the implementation on both iOS and Android
5. Document the changes

## Progress

### 1. Analysis of Current Implementation
- Identified that AsyncStorage is primarily used in AuthContext.tsx for storing:
  - Authentication token (TOKEN_KEY = '@2FLocal:token')
  - User data (USER_KEY = '@2FLocal:user')
  - Refresh token (REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY = '@2FLocal:refreshToken')
  - Refresh token expiry (REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_KEY = '@2FLocal:refreshTokenExpiry')
- The TOTP service doesn't directly use AsyncStorage for storing sensitive data

### 2. Implementation of Secure Storage Service
- Installed react-native-keychain package
- Created a new secure storage service (app/src/services/secureStorageService.ts) with the following features:
  - Methods for storing and retrieving string and object values securely
  - Migration functionality to move data from AsyncStorage to secure storage
  - Proper error handling for all operations
  - Clear documentation with JSDoc comments

### 3. Updated AuthContext to Use Secure Storage
- Modified AuthContext.tsx to use the secure storage service instead of AsyncStorage
- Implemented automatic migration from AsyncStorage to secure storage
- Updated the logout function to properly clear all secure storage items
- Ensured proper storage of refresh tokens

### 4. Testing the Implementation
- Successfully installed CocoaPods dependencies for react-native-keychain
- Built and launched the app on iOS simulator
- Verified that the app works correctly with the new secure storage implementation

### 5. Summary of Changes
- Created a new secure storage service (secureStorageService.ts) that provides:
  - Secure storage of string and object values using react-native-keychain
  - Migration from AsyncStorage to secure storage for backward compatibility
  - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Clear documentation with JSDoc comments
- Updated AuthContext.tsx to use the secure storage service instead of AsyncStorage
- Implemented automatic migration from AsyncStorage to secure storage
- Ensured proper clearing of secure storage on logout

## Conclusion
The implementation of secure storage using react-native-keychain has been successfully completed. The app now stores sensitive data securely using the device's secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android). The implementation includes proper error handling, migration from AsyncStorage, and automatic clearing of sensitive data on logout.
