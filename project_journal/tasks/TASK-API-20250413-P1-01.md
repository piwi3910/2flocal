# Task Log: TASK-API-20250413-P1-01 - API Development

**Goal:** Implement TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) code generation from stored secrets in the 2FLocal backend application.

## Context
The 2FLocal application is a two-factor authentication app that allows users to securely store and generate TOTP codes. The backend already has functionality for storing encrypted TOTP secrets, but is missing the implementation for generating the actual TOTP codes from these secrets.

## Requirements
1. Create a new endpoint for retrieving the current TOTP code for a specific account secret
2. Implement the TOTP generation algorithm according to RFC 6238
3. Ensure proper time synchronization for accurate code generation
4. Add appropriate error handling and validation
5. Ensure the implementation works with the existing encrypted secrets storage


## Implementation

### 1. TOTP Generator Utility

Created a new utility file `backend/src/utils/totpGenerator.ts` that implements the TOTP algorithm according to RFC 6238. The implementation includes:

- Base32 decoding of TOTP secrets
- HMAC-based OTP generation with SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 support
- Time synchronization with configurable time step (period)
- Configurable digit length
- Helper functions for getting remaining time until next code generation

### 2. API Endpoint

Added a new endpoint to retrieve the current TOTP code for a specific account secret:

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/accounts/:id/totp`
- **Authentication**: Requires JWT token
- **Response**: Returns the current TOTP code, remaining seconds until expiration, period length, and account information

The implementation includes proper error handling for:
- Authentication errors
- Missing parameters
- Non-existent account secrets
- Decryption failures
- Invalid secret formats

### 3. Testing

Created unit tests for the TOTP generator utility to ensure correct implementation of the RFC 6238 algorithm.

### 4. Documentation

Updated the OpenAPI specification to include the new endpoint and response schema.

## Optimization

The TOTP generation implementation includes several optimizations:

1. **Caching Prevention**: Each request generates a fresh TOTP code based on the current time, ensuring codes are always up-to-date
2. **Efficient Base32 Decoding**: Optimized base32 decoding algorithm for TOTP secrets
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes
4. **Time Synchronization**: Accurate time synchronization for proper code generation

---
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented TOTP code generation functionality with a new endpoint `GET /api/accounts/:id/totp` that retrieves the current TOTP code for a specific account secret. The implementation follows RFC 6238 and works with the existing encrypted secrets storage.
