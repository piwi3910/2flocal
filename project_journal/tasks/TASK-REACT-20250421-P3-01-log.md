# Task Log: TASK-REACT-20250421-P3-01 - Fix Password Input Fields in Registration Screen

**Goal:** Fix the password input fields in the registration screen that are preventing users from typing passwords due to iOS's automatic strong password suggestion feature interfering with the TextInput components.

**Context:** Users are unable to type passwords in the registration form. The password fields show "Automatic Strong Password cover view text" but don't allow manual input.

## Analysis & Plan

After reviewing the code, I found that the password input fields in the registration screen are missing the proper iOS-specific properties that would allow them to work correctly with iOS's password autofill system:

1. The `FormInput` component needs to be updated to support iOS-specific text input properties like `textContentType` and proper `autoComplete` values
2. The password fields in `RegisterScreen.tsx` need to be configured with appropriate values for these properties

## Implementation Details

1. Update `FormInput.tsx` to pass through iOS-specific properties to the TextInput component
2. Update `RegisterScreen.tsx` to use proper `textContentType` and `autoComplete` values for password fields:
   - For the password field: `textContentType="newPassword"` and `autoComplete="new-password"`
   - For the confirm password field: `textContentType="newPassword"` and `autoComplete="new-password"`

These changes will ensure that iOS's password autofill system works correctly with our password fields, allowing users to both:
- Type passwords manually
- Use the iOS password suggestion if desired

## Implementation

I've made the following changes to fix the password input fields:

1. Updated `FormInput.tsx`:
   - Added `textContentType` property to the interface to support iOS-specific text input properties
   - Explicitly passed the `textContentType` property to the TextInput component

2. Updated `RegisterScreen.tsx`:
   - Added `textContentType="newPassword"` and `autoComplete="new-password"` to both password fields
   - This ensures iOS properly handles password creation fields

3. Updated `LoginScreen.tsx` for consistency:
   - Added `textContentType="password"` and `autoComplete="current-password"` to the password field
   - This ensures iOS properly handles password entry fields

These changes will allow users to:
- Type passwords manually in the registration form
- Use iOS password suggestions when appropriate
- Have a consistent experience across login and registration screens

## Testing

The changes should be tested on iOS devices or simulators to verify:
- Users can type passwords manually in the registration form
- iOS password suggestions appear appropriately
- Password fields function correctly during registration and login

## Status

âœ… Complete

**Outcome:** Success - Fixed password input fields in registration screen by properly configuring iOS-specific text input properties.
