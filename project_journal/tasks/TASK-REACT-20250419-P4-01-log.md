# Task Log: TASK-REACT-20250419-P4-01 - React Development: Dark Mode Support

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive dark mode support for the 2FLocal mobile app, including system theme detection, user preferences, theme transitions, and OLED optimization.

**Context:** UI design system (TASK-UI-20250419-P4-01), existing ThemeProvider implementation

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the task requirements and existing code, I've identified the following components that need to be implemented or modified:

1. Enhanced ThemeProvider with:

   - User theme preference persistence
   - OLED dark mode support
   - Smooth theme transitions

2. ThemeSettingsScreen accessible from ProfileScreen

3. Update theme.ts to include OLED dark theme

4. Update navigation to include ThemeSettingsScreen

5. Ensure all screens use theme context for styling

## Implementation Plan

1. Update theme.ts to add OLED dark theme
2. Enhance ThemeProvider.tsx to support all required features
3. Create ThemeSettingsScreen.tsx
4. Update AppNavigator.tsx to include ThemeSettingsScreen
5. Update ProfileScreen.tsx to add navigation to ThemeSettingsScreen
6. Test all screens in both light and dark modes

- Theme preferences persist across app restarts
- OLED optimization works correctly on compatible devices

## Completion Summary

The dark mode support implementation for the 2FLocal mobile app has been successfully completed. The implementation includes:

1. **System Theme Detection**
   - The app now detects and applies the device's system theme by default
   - The app updates when the system theme changes

2. **User Theme Preferences**
   - Added a dedicated Theme Settings screen accessible from the Profile screen
   - Users can choose between light, dark, or system theme
   - Theme preferences are persisted using secure storage

3. **Dark Mode Styling**
   - All UI elements now use theme context for styling
   - Replaced hardcoded colors with theme colors

4. **Smooth Theme Transitions**
   - Added fade animations when switching between themes
   - Transitions are smooth and visually pleasing

5. **Custom Component Support**
   - All components now properly adapt to theme changes
   - Components use theme context for styling

6. **OLED Optimization**
   - Added true black (#000000) background for OLED screens
