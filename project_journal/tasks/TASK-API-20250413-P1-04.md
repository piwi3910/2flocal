# Task Log: TASK-API-20250413-P1-04 - API Development

**Goal:** Implement user-level device management functionality for the 2FLocal backend application.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add endpoint for users to view their own devices (already implemented)
2. Add endpoint for users to update their device information
3. Add endpoint for users to delete their own devices
4. Implement device verification process
5. Update OpenAPI documentation
6. Write unit tests for the new endpoints
## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enhanced Device Controller
Added the following functions to the device controller:
- `updateDevice`: Allows users to update their device information (name and type)
- `deleteDevice`: Allows users to delete their own devices
- `verifyDevice`: Implements a device verification process using a 6-digit code

Key security considerations:
- All endpoints verify that the device belongs to the authenticated user
- Input validation for all parameters
- Proper error handling with appropriate status codes

### 2. Updated Routes
Added the following routes to the devices router:
- `PUT /api/devices/:id`: Update device information
- `DELETE /api/devices/:id`: Delete a device
- `POST /api/devices/:id/verify`: Verify a device

### 3. Updated OpenAPI Documentation
Added documentation for the new endpoints in the OpenAPI specification.

### 4. Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests for all device controller functions:
- Tests for successful operations
- Tests for error cases (invalid input, unauthorized access, etc.)
- Tests for edge cases

## Implementation Notes
- The device verification process is implemented as a simple 6-digit code verification. In a production environment, this could be enhanced with email or SMS verification.
- The `lastSeen` timestamp is updated whenever a device is verified or updated, which can be used to track device activity.
- All device operations ensure that users can only manage their own devices, maintaining proper security boundaries.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented user-level device management functionality including endpoints for updating, deleting, and verifying devices. Added comprehensive unit tests and updated OpenAPI documentation.
