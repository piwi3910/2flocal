# ADR: Phased Implementation Approach for 2FLocal

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-04-13  
**Decision Maker:** Roo Commander  

## Context
The 2FLocal application has been analyzed (TASK-CMD-20250413-075551) and found to have several completed components but also significant missing functionality. We need to determine the most effective approach to implement the remaining features and bring the application to completion.

## Decision
We will implement the 2FLocal application using a phased approach with the following structure:

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Focus on implementing essential features for a minimum viable product
   - Prioritize TOTP generation, QR code handling, authentication UI, and TOTP management UI

2. **Phase 2: Security Enhancements (Week 3)**
   - Improve error handling, implement rate limiting, add refresh token mechanism
   - Implement secure storage and biometric authentication

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Week 4)**
   - Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Create comprehensive API and developer documentation

4. **Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (Week 5)**
   - Create and implement a consistent design system
   - Add dark mode support and animations

5. **Phase 5: DevOps and Deployment (Week 6)**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure staging and production environments
   - Implement monitoring and logging

## Rationale
1. **Prioritization of Core Functionality:**
   - The phased approach allows us to focus first on the essential features that make the application usable
   - Early implementation of core functionality enables faster testing and feedback

2. **Security as a Second Priority:**
   - Security enhancements are critical but build upon the core functionality
   - Addressing security early in the process (Phase 2) ensures it's not an afterthought

3. **Testing Before UI Polish:**
   - Ensuring functionality works correctly through testing is more important than visual polish
   - Documentation created alongside testing provides a solid foundation for future development

4. **UI/UX Improvements After Core Stability:**
   - Polishing the UI after core functionality and testing ensures we're not redesigning working features
   - Allows for a more cohesive design approach based on the complete feature set

5. **DevOps Last:**
   - Setting up deployment infrastructure after the application is stable and tested reduces rework
   - Allows for proper configuration based on the actual application requirements

## Consequences
1. **Positive:**
   - Clear roadmap for implementation with well-defined milestones
   - Early delivery of core functionality
   - Security considerations addressed early in the process
   - Testing and documentation prioritized before final polish
   - Logical progression that minimizes rework

2. **Negative:**
   - Initial versions will lack visual polish
   - Some security features won't be available in the earliest versions
   - Full deployment capabilities will come later in the process

3. **Mitigations:**
   - Regular reviews at the end of each phase to ensure quality
   - Security best practices still applied during core functionality development
   - Local testing environments used before formal DevOps setup
